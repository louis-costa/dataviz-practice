    "I am an Assistant Professor in Public Policy at Harvard Kennedy School.  My research focuses on firms and markets in developing countries and emerging economies, addressing two broad questions: First, what are the key barriers and constraints that hinder firm growth and upgrading in developing countries? Second, understanding these, how can we then structure effective policies to alleviate firm-level constraints and market frictions to facilitate private sector development? Methodologically, I combine large-scale randomized control trials, quasi-experimental applied micro techniques, and structural modeling tools from industrial organization and international trade. I also like to ground my empirical research in microeconomic theory to shed light on how firms make decision, and how markets are organized to generate incentives and allocate resources.\nFor the past ten years, I have conducted research in China, East Africa and Southeast Asia, where I have collaborated with governments and non-government organizations to design, implement and evaluate industrial, trade and development policies.\nI received my Ph.D. in Economics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in June 2016, and spent one year at Microsoft Research New England prior to joining HKS in 2017.\nSponsored projects include research, training, convening, and other initiatives externally funded through grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements.

    "My research focuses on public economics and development economics. One set of projects in my work seeks to study the factors that shape the capacity to tax and the choice of tax policy over the long run of development. Ultimately, this line of work aims to shed light on how should, and can, a government go from raising 5-10 percent of GDP in taxes to around 35-40 percent, while encouraging development more broadly. My second line of work consists in working with tax authorities and other government departments in developing countries. The starting point here is the specific structure, policies and issues of a given country. Through close collaborations and the use of large micro-datasets, these projects study what governments can do, given constrained capacity to tax, to incrementally improve tax administration, tax enforcement, tax policy, and tax morale. In this line of work, I am currently collaborating with governments in Ghana, Zambia, Liberia, and Brazil.\nI received my PhD in Economics from London School of Economics in 2016 and spent one year at NBER as a post-doctoral fellow before joining HKS.

    "Zoe Marks is a Lecturer in Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School. Her research and teaching focuses on the intersections of conflict and peacebuilding; gender and intersectional inequality; and African politics.\nDr. Marks has two book projects under way. Her first solo-authored book - Anatomy of an African Rebellion - examines how and why rebel groups can sustain a viable threat to the state without widespread support. It provides an in-depth case analysis of the internal dynamics of rebellion in Sierra Leone and draws on two years of fieldwork, several hundred interviews with former combatants, elected officials, and community members, as well as private archives from members of the Revolutionary United Front.\nHer second book project, Bread and Roses: Women at the Frontlines of Revolution, co-authored with Erica Chenoweth, documents the historic role women have played in violent and nonviolent mass movements globally since 1945. Drawing on a novel dataset on women in resistance (WiRe 2.0 and WiRe+), the authors argue that gender-inclusive mass movements are larger, more likely to succeed, and more likely to lead to democratic consolidation and gains in gender equality than movements dominated by men. It is under contract with Princeton University Press.\nIn addition to her work on civil war and revolutionary movements, Dr. Marks studies peacebuilding and community reintegration after war. Using surveys and social network analysis in Northeast Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, her research compares protracted conflict settings to explain how exposure to violence and conflict experiences affects intergroup reconciliation and peacebuilding.\nDr. Marks holds a DPhil in Politics and a MSc in African Studies from the University of Oxford, and a BA in Government and African American Studies from Georgetown University. Prior to joining the Kennedy School, she was a Chancellor’s Fellow and Lecturer (tenured) at the University of Edinburgh, where she directed the masters program in African Studies and was Director of the University's Global Development Academy.

    "My research focuses on public economics and development economics. One set of projects in my work seeks to study the factors that shape the capacity to tax and the choice of tax policy over the long run of development. Ultimately, this line of work aims to shed light on how should, and can, a government go from raising 5-10 percent of GDP in taxes to around 35-40 percent, while encouraging development more broadly. My second line of work consists in working with tax authorities and other government departments in developing countries. The starting point here is the specific structure, policies and issues of a given country. Through close collaborations and the use of large micro-datasets, these projects study what governments can do, given constrained capacity to tax, to incrementally improve tax administration, tax enforcement, tax policy, and tax morale. In this line of work, I am currently collaborating with governments in Ghana, Zambia, Liberia, and Brazil.\nI received my PhD in Economics from London School of Economics in 2016 and spent one year at NBER as a post-doctoral fellow before joining HKS.

    "Zoe Marks is a Lecturer in Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School. Her research and teaching focuses on the intersections of conflict and peacebuilding; gender and intersectional inequality; and African politics.\nDr. Marks has two book projects under way. Her first solo-authored book - Anatomy of an African Rebellion - examines how and why rebel groups can sustain a viable threat to the state without widespread support. It provides an in-depth case analysis of the internal dynamics of rebellion in Sierra Leone and draws on two years of fieldwork, several hundred interviews with former combatants, elected officials, and community members, as well as private archives from members of the Revolutionary United Front.\nHer second book project, Bread and Roses: Women at the Frontlines of Revolution, co-authored with Erica Chenoweth, documents the historic role women have played in violent and nonviolent mass movements globally since 1945. Drawing on a novel dataset on women in resistance (WiRe 2.0 and WiRe+), the authors argue that gender-inclusive mass movements are larger, more likely to succeed, and more likely to lead to democratic consolidation and gains in gender equality than movements dominated by men. It is under contract with Princeton University Press.\nIn addition to her work on civil war and revolutionary movements, Dr. Marks studies peacebuilding and community reintegration after war. Using surveys and social network analysis in Northeast Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, her research compares protracted conflict settings to explain how exposure to violence and conflict experiences affects intergroup reconciliation and peacebuilding.\nDr. Marks holds a DPhil in Politics and a MSc in African Studies from the University of Oxford, and a BA in Government and African American Studies from Georgetown University. Prior to joining the Kennedy School, she was a Chancellor’s Fellow and Lecturer (tenured) at the University of Edinburgh, where she directed the masters program in African Studies and was Director of the University's Global Development Academy.
